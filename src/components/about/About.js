          <p>I am a passionate Full Stack Developer who loves to explore new technologies and build scalable applications.Although I expertize in full-stack development, I prefer to work on the backend of any application.I am also interested in Blockchain development using Solidity, and can create blockchain-based applications.I have a good hold over developing Decentralized Applications or DApps using solidity smart-contracts.

I am also highly into Open Source and like to contribute to different projects. Currently, I have made 90+ Pull Requests, and created 30+ Issues on GitHub.More information about my Open Source profile is available at GitHub | Kailash Kejriwal.

Apart from coding, I love to write technical blogs on the latest and emerging technologies.All of my blogs are available on Medium | Kailash Kejriwal, where I post articles frequently.</p>
